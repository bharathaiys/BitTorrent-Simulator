2) Compile the code with the following command on the terminal:

       javac *.java
       
3) Ensure that the PeerInfo.cfg and Common.cfg files are added.
4) Navigate to the folder main folder src in 9 terminals
5) Run the following command in quick succession in the 9 terminals

 Peer 1001 and 1006 will initially have the file
